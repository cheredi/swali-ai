# Learning Progress

This file tracks your learning journey while building and improving Swali-AI.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand end-to-end RAG architecture deeply.
- Build reliable retrieval pipelines and evaluation habits.
- Improve API + frontend integration and delivery workflow.

## Milestones

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Read and understood backend architecture and data flow.
- Set up Poetry environment and test tooling.
- Verified core embedding/vector store tests.

### Phase 2 — Feature Development
- Implemented progressive hints with level normalization.
- Added follow-up question generation endpoint.
- Built React frontend for answer/hint/follow-up workflows.

### Phase 3 — Data Quality
- Added AI/ML ingestion pipeline (ingestion/normalize/deduplicate).
- Expanded indexed corpus and fixed ID collision issues.
- Improved retrieval consistency by fixing Chroma path mismatch.

### Phase 4 — Retrieval Evaluation
- Added hybrid reranker and two-stage retrieval.
- Added embedding model A/B experiment harness.
- Logged repeatable metrics (Recall@k, Precision@k, MRR).

## Current Focus (Now)
- Expand eval set size and diversity.
- Tune reranker weights using larger validation cases.
- Add CI automation and contribution workflow.
